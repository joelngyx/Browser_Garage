# BrowserGarage

A web application where you can play sounds, create beats and loops. This application was made with React JS, Bootstrap, SCSS, Howler JS and React-Media-Recorder (the last 2 are wrappers for Web Audio API). It is best experienced on a PC (with a keyboard).

All vectors are from theNounProject, and all sounds are from ProducerSpot.
